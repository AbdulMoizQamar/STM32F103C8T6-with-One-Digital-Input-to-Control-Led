# STM32F103C8T6-with-One-Digital-Input-to-Control-Led
Using the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, a digital input (e.g., a push button) can control an LED. The digital input pin reads the state of the button (pressed or not), and based on this input, the microcontroller toggles the LED's state (on or off) by driving an output pin connected to the LED.
